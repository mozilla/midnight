# pageload metrics

A collection of metrics that represent the progress of a web browser page load from the beginning of the browser request until the page is finished loading. There are many metrics, the twelve selected are picked due to current practice and observation on general page load behavior. YMMV. Metrics come from W3C Navigation Timing, Visual Metrics, Google's Web Vitals, and specialty metrics devised to detail network performance, accessibilty performance, or other focus area.
